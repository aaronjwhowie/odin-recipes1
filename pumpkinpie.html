            <ol>      
                <li> Halve pumpkin and scoop out seeds and stringy portions </li>
                <li> Cut the pumpkin into chunks. </li>
                <li>  In a saucepan over medium heat, cover the pumpkin chunks with 1 inch of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes or until tender. </li>
                <li> Drain, cool and remove the peel. Return pumpkin to the saucepan and mash with a potato masher or use a food mill.</li>
                
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>Prepare pie crust by mixing together the flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
                <li>Cut shortening into flour; add cold water 1 tablespoon at a time (you may need only 3 tablespoons, or up to 4 tablespoons).</li>
              
                <li> Mix dough and repeat until dough is moist enough to hold together. </li>
                <li>Shape the dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. </li>
            </ol>
<h3> 4.Form Pie Crust </h3>

            <ol> 
                <li> With lightly floured, hands shape dough into a ball. On a lightly floured board, roll dough out to about 1/8 inch thickness. </li>
                <li> With a sharp knife, cut dough 1 1/2 inch larger than the upside-down 8- to 9-inch pie pan. (You can use any dough scraps to make decorative shapes using small leaf-shaped cookie cutters and place them on top of the pie filling.) </li>
                <li> Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it right-side up onto the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pie pan. Form a crust by folding the overhanging edges under and crimp as desired. </li>
            
            </ol>
<h3> 5. Make Pie Filling </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> In a large bowl, beat pumpkin with evaporated milk, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt with an electric mixer or immersion blender. Mix well. </li>
                <li> Pour the filling into your prepared crust. </li>
